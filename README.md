🛡️ Cybersecurity Project Overview
-
This project explores the relationship between various types of cyberattacks and the resulting financial losses across different industries over the last decade. By analyzing both independent and dependent variables, the goal is to develop insights and ultimately propose a system to prevent future attacks.

🏭 Industry Type
-
Cybersecurity – With a focus on understanding financial loss and attack patterns in the digital threat landscape.

📖 Story of the Data
-
The dataset tells a compelling story of how cyberattacks have evolved over the past decade, and how much financial damage they have caused across different industries. It reveals systemic weaknesses and highlights the growing need for proactive security measures.

👥 Stakeholders of the Project
-
The Executives – Primary decision-makers who seek strategic insight into risk mitigation, cost management, and operational resilience in the face of cybersecurity threats.

🔍 Project Splits
-
The dataset is split into two major categories:

🧩 CATEGORY ONE – Independent Variables
-
- Country – Where the incident occurred

- Year – When the incident occurred

- Attack Type – e.g., Ransomware, phishing, DDoS

- Target Industry – e.g. Healthcare, finance, education

- Attack Source – Origin of attack or actor

- Security Vulnerability Type – e.g. Misconfigurations, zero-day exploits

- Defense Mechanism Used – e.g. Encryption, firewall, AI-based detection

📉 CATEGORY TWO – Dependent Variables
-
- Financial Loss – Estimated monetary loss

- Number of Affected Users – Count of impacted individuals

- Incident Resolution Time – Time taken to mitigate and resolve the incident

 In-Analysis Observations
 -
- 🏥 Healthcare suffered the most financial damage, incurring a total loss of $2,867.08 due to cyberattacks.

- 📅 In 2022, targeted industries experienced the highest financial loss, while 2019 showed early indicators of systemic vulnerability.

- 📉 Over the last 5 years, total losses amounted to $8,760.68, likely contributing to manpower reductions.

- 🤖 AI-based detection systems had the longest resolution time, averaging 62 hours.

- 🔐 Encryption and firewall methods had the shortest resolution time, at 53 hours.

- 🌏 India showed the fastest incident resolution, while UK incidents took approximately 32 hours to resolve.

💡 Recommendations
-
- Prioritize Prevention in High-Risk Sectors – Industries like healthcare should implement stronger intrusion detection and response systems due to their high exposure and losses.

- Invest in Proactive Defense Technologies – While AI-based detection is powerful, resolution times can be high. Invest in hybrid systems that combine speed and intelligence.

- Strengthen Global Best Practices – Countries with slower resolution times should study response models from regions like India to reduce time-to-containment.

- Year-on-Year Risk Modeling – Use historical data (like the early losses seen in 2019) to forecast and prepare for future threats.

- Executive Training – Educate stakeholders on interpreting cyber-risk data to support faster and more informed decision-making.

🧾 Conclusion
-
The data reveals clear patterns in how cyberattacks impact industries, particularly in financial terms and response efficiency. By focusing on prevention, speed of resolution, and proactive planning, organizations can significantly reduce their vulnerability. This project lays the groundwork for future system designs that will help companies stay ahead of digital threats.
